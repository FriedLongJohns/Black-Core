Black Core is a little turn-based text display game I made for fun, and because I wanted to make something cool.

The entire game is played with only number, q, WASD, arrow, and enter keys. All of it.

The game itself is quite simple: Choose equipment, then venture out into a randomized map with enemies do destroy in it.

There might be many more enemies than players, but the player moves much quicker than the enemies.

Every action in the game takes time, so if you're quick you might be able to attack the enemy then run away before it can do anything, and vice versa for a slow unit.

On the more technical side of things, I very much had fun with pathfinding for the first time - although not so much with good AI, and I'll admit I've reworked the math functions many, many times to get them to work correctly.

I hope you enjoy it.
